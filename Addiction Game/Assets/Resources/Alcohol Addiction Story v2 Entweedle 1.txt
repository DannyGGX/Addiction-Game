He reaches for the glass of water on his nightstand, but it's empty, a cruel reminder of his forgotten intention to stay hydrated. Thoughts of work creep in, making his stomach churn with anxiety. He knows he's late, but the idea of facing another day in the drab office while feeling like this is almost unbearable.
